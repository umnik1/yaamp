;                    REGION.TXT STRUCTURE FOR DEFINING SKIN MASKS
;
;The region information comes without any supporting documentation
;so I thought I might as well make some.
;
;The region.txt in WinAmp 1.92 allows us to some interesting things with transparencies
;But how does it work?
;
;Well, basically, it lets you define a set of polygons. Anything inside a polygon is drawn. Anything not in a polygon is not drawn. Simple heh?
;For how to define it have a look below at the first block. Un-comment it now. Don't worry about commenting the actual one lower down, if WinAmp finds multiple definitions, it only does the first and ignores the rest
;
;How to make a mask
;1. Type [Normal]. Real simple that one. (My guess is it is just for forward compatibility)
;2. Just type the NumPoints= and leave the number blank, we'll fill it in later
;3. OK, now for the fun part.
;   The co-ordinates you should type in are the OUTSIDE pixel co-ordinates in x,y format.
;   Start at the top lefthand corner and work your way CLOCKWISE around you polygon.
;   Now WinAmp ONLY accepts the PointList as one line of comma seperated variables.
;   You can use spaces, but DONT GO ONTO A NEW LINE. Clear? Good. :)
;   One last thing, don't type the first position again at the end, WinAmp joins them.
;   Putting a space between each pair is simply common sense, right?
;4. Once your done, count the number of co-ords, and fill in that number for NumPoints.
;
;Oh, as a side note, the x variables go from 0 to 275, and the y from 0 to 116.
;So if you look at the first example you can see I've gone across the second top line, gone down a bit, ducked in one pixel, gone down to the bottom, and across and back up the other side, putting another ledge on the other side.

;This does the outside border, and chops some bits out on the top and edges
;[Normal]
;NumPoints=8    ;Do this LAST!
;PointList=0,1,  275,1,  275,14,  274,14,  274,115,  1,115,  1,14,  0,14  

;Cool heh? Very subtle effect. Now lets try a more complex one, with multiple polygons
;For your first hard(ish) mask, I suggest defining each element as a seperate mask.
;It makes them a bit easier to think about.

;First, lets define an area that JUST does the titlebar.
;[Normal]
;NumPoints=4
;PointList=0,1,  275,1,  275,14,  0,14

;Simple as can be :)
;Go ahead, uncomment it and have a look. Just remember to recomment everything above it
;Doing your areas one at a time does speed the process up a bit

;Now lets define JUST the area sort of inside the outer ring
;[Normal]
;NumPoints = 4
;PointList = 3,15,  272,15,  272,113,  3,113

;Right, so say we want a mask that has, the titlebar AND the main area.
;We just add them together
; [Normal] 
; NumPoints = 4, 4  ;Make sure to get the order right(although it doesnt matter here =P )
; PointList = 0,1, 275,1, 275,14, 0,14,     3,15, 272,15, 272,113, 3,113

;Dont forget to add that extra comma after the first set.
; Having that bigger gap that lets you "keep it in your head" easier, it's a good idea

;OK, now lets try something tricky. We are going to make a mask for just one green line around the outside of the skin
;This introduces the other "big thing" with masks. Have a look at the first three co-ordinates below. You can see the first two moves we make are to go one to the side and then go down to the bottom. Looking at the last co-ordinate you can see we will come back up at the end, making a line two wide, right? 
;WRONG!! Here comes the big important phrase.
;IF YOU ARNT FOLLOWING THE OUTSIDE EDGE, YOUR CO-ORDINATES MARK TRANSPARENT SPACE LIMITS
;That's right. Because I don't make a square, because I have to turn "inside" the box, I am only marking space, and what I end up with is a mask with one green line.
;WARNING: Leave your skins dialog open when you do this one. :)
;[Normal]
;NumPoints = 8
;PointList = 1,14,  2,14,  2,114,  273,114,  273,14,  274,14,  274,115,  1,115

;OK, as the final touch lets add lets the border we just made to the other two.
;You should be able to work this out on your own
;[Normal]
;NumPoints = 4, 4, 8
;PointList = 0,1, 275,1, 275,14, 0,14,     3,15, 272,15, 272,113, 3,113,     1,14, 2,14, 2,114, 273,114, 273,14, 274,14, 274,115, 1,115

;hmm... that still looks a bit tacky down the bottom right
;So I'm going to modify it a bit
;See if you can work out what I've had to alter just by looking at the display of it
;[Normal]
;NumPoints = 4, 4, 8
;PointList = 0,1, 275,1, 275,14, 0,14,     3,15, 272,15, 272,80, 3,80,     1,14, 2,14, 2,81, 273,81, 273,14, 274,14, 274,115, 1,115

;The other good thing about doing your mask in bits and pieces like this is that can make multiple versions so you can change as your whims change
